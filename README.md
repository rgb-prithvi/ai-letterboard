# AI-Assisted Communication (AAC) App

An innovative communication assistance tool designed to empower autistic individuals and people with speech difficulties. Built with Next.js 14, this project aims to make assisted communication more accessible, natural, and effective.

## üåé Background

This project was inspired by my younger brother, who is autistic and uses AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tools to communicate effectively. While exploring existing AAC solutions, I noticed that many were expensive and cumbersome to use. This motivated me to create a more accessible, user-friendly alternative that leverages modern AI technology to enhance the communication experience.

The impact of AAC tools can be transformative - I've witnessed firsthand how access to better communication tools can help individuals progress academically and express themselves more fully. This project aims to make such tools more accessible to everyone who needs them.
